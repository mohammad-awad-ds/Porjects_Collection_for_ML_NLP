This is a public repository to showcase some of the Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based projects I've completed in the form of Jupyter notebooks as part of the MSc in Data Science program at PSUT, inlcuding:
- Medical disease detection by training neural networks (MLP and CNN models) on brain imagery data.
- Arabic language hatespeech detection using Spark and NLP concepts.
- Software defects detection using classical ML models.
